            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Horchata is a favorite Mexican beverage that has made its way into the United States and beyond. 
                The sweet, creamy taste of this beverage is delightful on its own, and many chefs have also 
                come up with scrumptious desserts that mimic it. There is now even a horchata-inspired liquor you can buy in bottles.
            </p>

                Horchata is a type of plant-based milk that is usually sweetened and sometimes flavored with spices, 
                extracts and other ingredients. While Mexican-style horchata is the most commonly known variety in the US, 
                horchata actually originated in Spain, and there are various types of horchatas throughout the Spanish-speaking world.

                    Pour sugar, cinnamon, and rice into hot water; stir until sugar dissolves. 
                    Cover, and let stand at room temperature for at least 3 hours, but preferably overnight.

                    Stir in milk, then puree with a hand blender, or in batches in a standing blender 
                    until the rice resembles fine sand. Strain through several layers of cheesecloth, 
                    or through a very fine strainer. Serve over ice.
